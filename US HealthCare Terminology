U.S. Healthcare – IPA, Health Plan, Claims & Key Terminology
1. Health Plan
A health plan is the insurer/payor that provides coverage and pays for healthcare services.
Examples of Health Plans:
Medicare
Medicare Advantage (private health plans)
Original Medicare (government fee-for-service)
Medicaid
Managed Medicaid (MCOs)
Fee-for-Service Medicaid
Commercial / Private Insurance
Employer-sponsored plans
Individual ACA plans
👉 Medicare and Medicaid ARE health plans, but not the only ones.

2. IPA (Independent Practice Association)
An IPA is an organization that contracts with health plans on behalf of independent physicians and sometimes hospitals or other providers.
IPA may be delegated by the health plan to:
Process claims
Pay providers
Perform utilization management
IPA is NOT the payor, but may pay claims on behalf of the health plan

3. Payor
The payor is the entity that ultimately pays for healthcare services.
Examples:
Health plans (Medicare Advantage, Managed Medicaid, Commercial plans)
👉 IPA administers payments, but the health plan is the true payor.

4. Provider
A provider is any licensed individual or facility that delivers healthcare services.
Includes:
Doctors (MD / DO)
Nurse practitioners (NP)
Physician assistants (PA)
Hospitals, labs, imaging centers

5. Member / Patient
The member (patient/beneficiary) is the person enrolled in a health plan who receives healthcare services.

6. Claim
A claim is a request for payment submitted by the provider to the health plan or IPA for services provided to a member.
👉 A claim is NOT a contract.

7. Date of Service (DOS)
The date on which the provider delivers healthcare services to the member.

8. Received Date
The date the IPA or health plan receives the claim.
Used to determine:
Timely filing
Payment turnaround time

9. Copay
A fixed dollar amount the member pays at the time of service.
The remaining allowed amount is paid by the health plan (or IPA per contract).

10. Coinsurance
A percentage of the allowed amount the member pays, usually after the deductible is met.

11. Deductible
The amount the member must pay annually before the health plan begins paying for covered services.

12. Authorization (Prior Authorization)
Approval required before certain services to confirm:
Medical necessity
Coverage under the health plan
👉 Authorization is NOT eligibility.

13. Withhold
A portion of provider payment held by the IPA, usually released later based on:
Financial performance
Quality metrics
Contract terms

14. Adjustment Code
Codes used on a claim to explain:
Denial
Reduction
Modification of payment
(e.g., missing authorization, bundling, timely filing)

15. Release to AP (Accounts Payable)
Indicates the claim is approved and ready for payment.

16. Timely Filing
A rule requiring providers to submit claims within a defined time limit.
Late submission may result in:
Denial
Payment reduction

17. Interest
If the IPA or health plan fails to pay within the required timeframe, interest may be applied based on:
State law
Contract terms
HMO, POS, and PPO are types of health insurance plans, and the difference is mainly about provider choice, referrals, and cost. Here’s a clear, side-by-side explanation.

18. HMO (Health Maintenance Organization)
Key Features
PCP required (Primary Care Physician)
Referrals required to see specialists
Only in-network care is covered (except emergencies)
Lowest cost (lower premiums, copays)
How it works
Member chooses a PCP
PCP coordinates all care
IPA involvement is very common
Best for
Lower cost
Structured care
Less flexibility

19. PPO (Preferred Provider Organization)
Key Features
No PCP required
No referral needed for specialists
In-network and out-of-network coverage
Higher cost (higher premiums, coinsurance)
How it works
Member can see any provider
In-network costs less
Out-of-network costs more
Best for
Flexibility
Direct access to specialists

20. POS (Point of Service)
Key Features
Hybrid of HMO and PPO
PCP required
Referrals usually required
Out-of-network coverage allowed (with higher cost)
How it works
Works like HMO in-network
Works like PPO when going out-of-network
Best for
Moderate flexibility
Moderate cost

Medicare & Medicaid = WHO provides coverage. They are types of health plans that provide insurance coverage
HMO / PPO / POS = HOW coverage is structured. These describe how the coverage works, not who provides it

21. Billed Amount
Definition: The total amount the provider charges for a service rendered to the member.

22. Allowed Amount
Definition: The maximum amount the health plan will recognize and pay for a service according to the contracted rate with the provider.
The member and health plan together never pay more than this amount.

23. Net Amount
Net Amount is the final amount the health plan or IPA actually pays to the provider for a claim.

Assume:
Billed Amount = $1,000
Allowed Amount = $600
Copay = $50
Deductible = $300
Coinsurance = $50
Step 1: Calculate Total Member Responsibility
$50 (copay) + $300 (deductible) + $50 (coinsurance) = $400
Step 2: Net Amount Paid by Plan / IPA
Allowed Amount = $600
Member pays $400
Net Amount = $600 − $400 = $200
